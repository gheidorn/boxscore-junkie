#summary Interpretation of the RESTful XML behind the Scoreboard

= Scoreboard =

The scoreboard refers to the game scores across the Major Leagues for a given day.  There is an assumed format that gets tweaked now and then as new stats are popularized, such as On-Base Percentage (OBP) and On-Base Plus Slugging (OPS) in recent years.  This page describes that general "human-readable" format and then the XML/JSON formats provided by MLBAM.
